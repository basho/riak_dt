%% the compact_threshold is a number between 0.0 and 1.0:
%%
%% - closer to 0.0 means compact less often, but compact more bytes 
%%   (ie few large compactions)
%% - closer to 1.0 means compact more often, but compact less bytes
%%   (ie many small compactions)
%%
%% We compact if a calculated value is between 0.0 and the compact_threshold
%% (i.e. we compact as much as possible each time)
%%
%% For example:
%% GCounters: Compacted when ROActors/TotalActors   < compact_threshold
%% ORSets:    Compacted when (1 - Tombstones/Total) < compact_threshold
%% 
%% To make this simple, choose one of two possible calculations:
%% * Calced = KeptSize / CurrentSize
%% * Calced = 1 - (RemovedSize / CurrentSize)
